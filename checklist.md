## Front-End Design (10 pts)

_Yes_ 2 pts: Game has a **functional text-based interface** that allows the player to control their movement through the game.

_Yes_ 2 pts: Submission includes a **cheat sheet** (`cheatsheet.md`) documenting all of the available commands, as well as a **description of the layout** of your game world's underlying physical layout; this can be described in words, or included as a separate image file if you prefer to sketch a map by hand.  If your game includes **challenges** that must be overcome to win, also describe them here.

_Yes_ 2 pts: Storyline driving the game is **engaging**, and individual elements of play make sense within the context of the story.

_Yes_ 2 pts: Game has **multiple possible paths / outcomes** (i.e. gameplay depends on player's choices and is not the same every time).


_Yes_ 1 pt: Some paths through the game have **restricted access** until the player has completed a task or acquired a specific item (i.e. a key to open a door, etc.).


## Back-End Design (10 pts)

_Yes_ 2 pts: Selected data structure(s) are **effective, efficient** at supporting the desired operations and program behavior.

_Yes_ 2 pts: Design justification includes a discussion of at least one (reasonable) **alternative data structure** that could have been used, and the reasons why you decided against this alternative.

_Yes_ 2 pts: The project makes effective use of **Java built-in classes** whenever they are appropriate.

_Yes_ 2 pts: The project's design is **extensible** (i.e. someone else could pick up where you left off, adding on or modifying the game without requiring a total rewrite).

_Yes_ 2 pts: Submission includes an **architecture diagram** describing the relationships between all classes.

## General Items (10 pts):
